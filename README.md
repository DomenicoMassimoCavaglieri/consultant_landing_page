## :pushpin: About ##

Fictitious landing page of a consulting firm.<br>
The aim is to demonstrate the ability to use web languages and technologies.<br>
<br>
The program generates an HTML file from a personal template, compiles a minified bundle of all modules in the project, and extracts the style component into a separate, minified bundle. The JS and CSS syntax are both transpilated for backward compatibility.<br>
